# Collatz-project
# Collatz Conjecture Solver This project provides a Python implementation of the Collatz Conjecture. It takes a number as input and applies the Collatz transformation (if the number is even, divide by 2, if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1) until it reaches 1. The program will display each step of the sequence.
